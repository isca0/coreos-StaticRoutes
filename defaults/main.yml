# All you need to set routes is the gateway and network addresses 
# If you think as iproute way, the normal language syntax will be something like:
#  
# 10.0.0.0/8 via 172.17.12.1
#
# where 10.0.0.0/8 will be the network and 172.17.12.1 will be the gateway
#
# You can set multiple routes by dooing like this:
# 
# - { network: 10.0.0.0/8, gateway: 172.17.12.1 }
# - { network: 192.168.125.0/28, gateway: 10.12.13.1 }
# ...
#

routes:
  - { network: 192.168.152.0/30, gateway: 10.12.13.15 }
